# ü§ñ AI Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

This project is a simple demonstration of an AI-powered recommendation system built in Java. It implements a **user-based collaborative filtering** algorithm to suggest items to a user. The system works by analyzing a dataset of user ratings, finding users with similar tastes, and then recommending items that similar users have liked but the target user has not yet rated.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Collaborative Filtering:** Implements the core logic for a user-based collaborative filtering system.
* **Pearson Correlation:** Uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to mathematically measure the similarity between two users based on their commonly rated items.
* **Weighted Predictions:** Generates a predicted rating for new items by calculating a weighted average of ratings from similar users. The similarity score itself acts as the weight.
* **Dynamic Recommendations:** The system is designed to only recommend items that the target user has not previously seen or rated.
* **Sorted Output:** The final recommendations are sorted by their predicted scores in descending order, showing the most relevant items first.
* **Sample Data:** Includes a hardcoded sample dataset of users and their item ratings for immediate demonstration.
