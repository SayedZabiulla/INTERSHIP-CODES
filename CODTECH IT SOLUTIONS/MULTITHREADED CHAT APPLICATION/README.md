# üì° Java Multi-Client Chat Application

This project is a classic command-line based, client-server chat application built using Java Sockets. It features a multi-threaded server that can accept and manage connections from multiple clients simultaneously. When a client sends a message, the server broadcasts it to every other client connected to the chat room.

## ‚ú® Features

### Server (`ChatServer.java`)
* **Multi-Threaded:** Employs a new thread for each client connection, allowing it to handle multiple clients concurrently.
* **Centralized Broadcasting:** Receives a message from one client and relays it to all other connected clients.
* **Connection Management:** Dynamically maintains a list of connected clients, adding new ones and removing those who disconnect.
* **Listens on Port 5000:** The server is hardcoded to listen for client connections on port 5000.

### Client (`ChatClient.java`)
* **Concurrent Operations:** Uses a dedicated thread to listen for incoming messages from the server, allowing the user to send and receive messages simultaneously without blocking.
* **User Identification:** Prompts the user to enter a name, which is prefixed to their messages.
* **Simple UI:** Operates entirely within the command-line for sending and viewing messages.
* **Connects to Localhost:** The client is configured to connect to the server at `localhost:5000`.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Compile the Code:**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the files, and compile both `.java` files.
    ```bash
    javac ChatServer.java ChatClient.java
    ```

2.  **Start the Server:**
    In the same terminal, start the server. It will wait for clients to connect.
    ```bash
    java ChatServer
    ```

3.  **Start Clients:**
    Open a **new terminal window** for each chat client you want to run.
    ```bash
    java ChatClient
    ```
    Repeat this step in separate terminal windows to have multiple users in the chat room.

4.  **Chat:**
    Each client terminal will ask for a name. After entering a name, you can start typing messages. The messages will appear in the terminals of all other connected clients.
